Udemy Assignment - Python Tic Tac Toe game

Milestone Project 1
Congratulations on making it to your first milestone!
You've already learned a ton and are ready to work on a real project.

Your assignment: Create a Tic Tac Toe game. You are free to use any IDE you like.

Here are the requirements:

2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board
Feel free to use Google to help you figure anything out (but don't just Google "Tic Tac Toe in Python" otherwise you won't learn anything!) Keep in mind that this project can take anywhere between several hours to several days.

There are parts of this that will be a struggle...and that is good! I have complete faith that if you have made it this far through the course you have all the tools and knowledge to tackle this project. Remember, it's totally open book, so take your time, do a little research, and remember:

HAVE FUN!
